      I am working on getting a degree in software engineering with a hope of owning and
      operating my own video game company. I am a huge nerd in every sense of
      the word. I love video games, movies, TV shows, and anything that tells a
      story. I am married. I will married for two years end of april. We have a
      three month old girl and I have much fun spending a lot of time with my
      wife and baby, if I am not doing homework. The part I love about BYUI the
      most is a weird one but a simple one as well. I love that there is a much
      greater focus on the learning and studying than any school pride or
      emphasis on sports events. I never thought I would like how much that is
      not present but it really helps the whole school develop a love of
      learning above all. Since I have no issue with learning all I can about
      the art of programming in general I will see a time where I may need to
      know how to design a website even if I have to do it all myself. I like
      knowing how to do things so I can make it even better in my own way. I
      have been a member of the church all my life and I served a mission in
      Ventura, California I have been home five years now and I have so many
      favorite quotes from our leaders. the one that sticks out to me the most
      is when president Holland said, "the first great commandment is to love
      God, but the first great truth is that he loves you." My favorite
      scripture is in Ecclesiastes 1:18.
