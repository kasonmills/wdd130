                <h1>The Dark Side of Gliamoor</h1>
                <p>
                    The dark side of Gliamoor was almost uninhabitable and is vastly less populated compared
                    to the light side. Until amulets that would protect you from the extreme conditions were
                    common place very few people even dared to traverse there. The political structure is that
                    of a dictatorship where there is one ruler who rules with an iron fist. He controls all of
                    the means of production for all produce and livestock. This side of the planet is much
                    more varied in the terrain as there are hills, valleys, rivers, mountains, and lakes covering
                    major swaths of the land.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of the buildings are new or built within the last hundred years. Many new business have
                    popped as more and more people move to live on the dark side of the planet. With so many new
                    people also spell more chaos and disaster if the influx wasn't handled properly. Sufficed to
                    say structure and orginization are almost non existent here.

                <h2>The political scene</h2>
                <p>
                    Malzareth Korr is the first person to venture into the dark side and return alive. This has been
                    his story and help bolster his reputation that let him gain the opportunity to organize a
                    governing body and place himself at the top in the place of power. All business is either in
                    control of the goverment or you are considered a contractor of the goverment and allowed to
                    operate independantly because they basically bribe the government to leave them alone. Malzareth
                    also provides significant "contributions" to key corrupt galactic officals so they turn a blind
                    eye at his less than legal business dealings. He is a fan of labor camps where if someone who lives
                    under his rule and they aren't able to pay his taxes then he sends them to a labor camp to provide
                    free labor harvesting and working the fields of the goverment.
                </p>

            <div class="dark-ecology">
                <h2>The Ecology</h2>
                <p>
                    There are vastly more plants native to this side of the planet scattered throughout the land. The
                    extreme cold prevents many plants that can't handle the intense cold to not be reasonable to try
                    and grow here. Strangely enough many of the plants that exist on the light side share a similar
                    visual similarity to many of the plants found on this side. Almost as if as one point this planet
                    didn't always have one side always facing the star it orbits. But what could be powerful enought
                    to prevent a whole planet from spinning on its axis?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest animal of note on this side is the Vaelgrim. It is a massive 10 foot tall dog-like beast 
                    that roams the darkness in packs on the hunt for anything to satisfy their omnivore diet. The Vaelgrim
                    are quite inteligent and have strong sense of danger making them naturally warry about people.
                    Malzareth and some of his followers have managed to tame a few of them and sell their fur to be made
                    into all sorts of things as it is extremely soft and quite strong and flexible material. 
                </p>

            <div class="dark-black-market">
                <h2>The Black Market</h2>
                <p>
                    Like with many places there is a thriving crime ring and a huge black market of less than legal good
                    being bought and sold. Malzareth chooses to ignore this whole operation as long as they pay their taxes
                    he lets them be. This in turn has helped make it so that many honest and law abiding folk don't have
                    much choice to try and run their own business because they can't compete in this enviroment unless
                    they pay top dollar for security around their work to ensure that all of what is your remains that way.
                    Malzareth does employ "soliders" and mercanries who are mainly in charge of "keeping" the peace and
                    keeping the indentured servants in line on the farms and ranches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is the blantant atmosphere of thrill seekers and thieves that has inspired many of the wealthy to
                    "contract" these lowlifes to hide and protect specific treasures so that their most precious items are
                    secure. The problem is that the prefered hiding spot of many of the rich is to find a secluded part of
                    the undergound tunnel system and put protection around their treasures and let the natural barriers in
                    addition to their own magic to disuade people from trying to get their hands on it.
