                <p>
                    The Light side of Gliamoor or the side that faces the sun and is mostly covered by vast
                    farmland and pastures mainly owned by the "mob" crime families who represent the whole
                    political structure. The capital city sits at the highest point of the world and the
                    place where the world gets the most light at any given point.

                <h2>The Political scene</h2>
                <p>
                    The Virello family business is the family that holds all the power because they own the 
                    most land and they also own this biggest business on the light side. Their main export 
                    is all produce that is not native to Gliamoor but will still thrive in the light. everyone
                    in the Virello family is an Air Genasi and uses their natural magical talents to help all 
                    their plants thrive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Grenthos clan is a smaller group than the Virello family but not by much. Their main 
                    export is livestock. Often they are also in charge of raising and slaughtering their own
                    animals. Their best seller is Vorrak'thul legs. All greater treatment is given to those
                    who actually bear the Grenthos name they aren't against adopting outsiders if they like
                    them enough. Since they have to deal so often with the Vorrak'thul if you are an Earth
                    Genasi or a Fire Genasi so are better equiped to handle them because they can get quite
                    violent if they feel threatened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Dreknari syndicate is vastly smaller family but just as dangerous. The family consists
                    of only Water Genasi and they are responsible for supplying the other two families with
                    all the water and fertlizer that is needed to maintain the immense farming operations they run.
                    The main issue is that many of the plants grown here are used to feed any livestock because of
