                <h1>The Light side of Gliamoor</h1>
                <p>
                    The Light side of Gliamoor or the side that faces the sun and is mostly covered by vast
                    farmland and pastures mainly owned by the "mob" crime families who represent the whole
                    political structure. The capital city sits at the highest point of the world and the
                    place where the world gets the most light at any given point.

                <h2>The Political scene</h2>
                <h3>The Virello Family</h3>
                <p>
                    The Virello family business is the family that holds all the power because they own the 
                    most land and they also own this biggest business on the light side. Their main export 
                    is all produce that is not native to Gliamoor but will still thrive in the light. everyone
                    in the Virello family is an Air Genasi and uses their natural magical talents to help all 
                    their plants thrive.
                </p>
                <h3> The Grenthos clan</h3>
                <p>
                    The Grenthos clan is a smaller group than the Virello family but not by much. Their main 
                    export is livestock. Often they are also in charge of raising and slaughtering their own
                    animals. Their best seller is Vorrak'thul legs. All greater treatment is given to those
                    who actually bear the Grenthos name they aren't against adopting outsiders if they like
                    them enough. Since they have to deal so often with the Vorrak'thul if you are an Earth
                    Genasi or a Fire Genasi so are better equiped to handle them because they can get quite
                    violent if they feel threatened.
                </p>
                <h3>The Dreknari syndicate</h3>
                <p>
                    The Dreknari syndicate is vastly smaller family but just as dangerous. The family consists
                    of only Water Genasi and they are responsible for supplying the other two families with
                    all the water and fertlizer that is needed to maintain the immense farming operations they run.
                    The main issue is the Vorrak'thul are meat eaters and they have no interest in anything else.
                    So they also import hundreds on animals from the dark side of the planet to feed them.

                <h2>The Ecology</h2>
                <p>
                    There are so many plants that have been brought to Gliamoor that very few of the native plants
                    are even left. There are patches of wild growth and untamed land but they are the exception not
                    the rule. The most commonly seen and farmed plant that is native to Gliamoor is what is locally
                    known as the "Wailing wheat." This unsuspecting plant is a bright yellow while it grows but 
                    turns a dark red when it is ready to be harvested. The unique properties of this plant are that
                    if you wander in a field of it its defense mechanism triggers and the whole field will turn 
                    pink and a silent "wail" will begun to be heard in your mind. If you spend too much time wandering
                    in these fields while they remain pink you will be under constant psychic attack as it will deal
                    one d6 psychic damage for every 15 seconds you are within 5 feet of the plant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other plant native to Gliamoor that still remains is the black grapes the grow all all sorts
                    of structures and other
                </p>
