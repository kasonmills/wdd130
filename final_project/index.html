      <h1>Explore the Mysteries of Gliamoor</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my personal website where I have outlined some information
        about my own homebrew world that am using in a campaign for my group to play
        sessions of Dungeons and Dragons.

        <h2>Gliamoor's political system</h2>
        <p>
          Gliamoor is one of the few worlds that has no central governing
          bodies. Even thought it is quite the wealthy place full of very
          profitable exports, no action has been taken by the intergalactic
          governing body to change the power dynamic between the two separate
          governments that each only care about their side of the planet. The
          side facing its star runs quite like a dictatorship where the wealthy
          farmers and politician create and maintain laws that only really
          benefit them with most of the lower class citizens essentially being
          slaves to their whims. The side not facing the star is a blend of
          lawlessness and survival of the fittest. The one who holds the power
          is the one who has defeated all of his rivals. Since it is never
          likely that only one group will hold all the power there is constant
          war and fighting breaking out when one group or another tries to grab
          more power. Order is maintained by force and everyone either shows
          devotion to strength or is relentlessly hunted. the middle ring of the
          planet is called the merchant district for it is the location that all
          the goods are moved off planet to be sold to the greater galaxy at
          large. similar to the dark side of the planet there is no one central
          governing authority. Yet there is some intergalactic policing presence
          so it makes it so that everyone is responsible for protecting
          themselves and their goods.

        <h2>Gliamoor's underground</h2>
        <p>
          Over the centuries many caverns and underground tunnels have either
          been dug or discovered with many ancient magical beasts and treasures
          to be found. These caverns have mostly attracted many the adventurer
          or seeker of wealth to find them and return the lost items for a
          massive reward. There have been countless rumors of the kinds of
          beasts that linger there and many have died trying exploring the caves
          alone. Many rich and powerful people have decided that these caverns
          are the idea place to store there ill begotten treasures and artifacts
          simply because of the deadly nature of the caverns protecting them
          easily being hoarded there. In addition to the caves there are several
          underground structures from ancient and civilizations that have long
          since been abandoned. These underground structures are also full of
          ancient treasures guarded by magical traps and naturally built traps
          to protect their long abandoned treasure. The beasts who dwell in
          these caverns and call this place home have also developed a unique
          biology to take advantage of the bioluminescent nature that much of
          the dark side of the planet also enjoys taking advantage of to have a
          thriving and beautiful natural diversity of animal and plant life
          alike.

        <h2>Gliamoor's "neutral" zone</h2>
        <p>
          Gliamoor's neutral zone is the zone of trade and selling the goods from
          both sides of the planet. There is no official governing body over
          this area because of the disputed nature of both sides claiming it is
          under their control but employing no specific enforcement of their
          rule there due to the great distance from that zone to the capitals of
          both sides not having significant enough resources to maintain a large
          enough force to maintain control. This resulted in many small factions
          that all control one or more monopolistic control of the one set of
          goods they sell to the greater galaxy at large. Aside from the
          galactic forces protecting the magic portals that demonstrate the only
          method of entering or leaving the planet at all. Each faction that is
          trying for control, only tries to control their portion of the zone
          they can reasonably command. Not a single group would ever dare to
          seize control of the portals off world because the galactic forces
          guarding them are never to be messed with because they are the most
          well trained soldiers in the galaxy.
