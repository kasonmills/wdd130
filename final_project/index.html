      <p>
        Gliamoor is one of the few worlds that has no central governing bodies. Even thought it is quite the wealthy
        place full of very pofitable
        exports, no action has been taken by the intergalactic governing body to change the power dynamic between the
        two seperate goverments that
        each only care about their side of the planet. The side facing its star runs quite like a dictatorship where the
        wealthy farmers and
        politicans create and maintain laws that only really benefit them with most of the lower class citizens
        essentially being slaves to their
        whims. The side not facing the star is a blend of lawlessness and survival of the fittest. The one who holds the
        power is the one who has
        defeated all of his rivals. Since it is never likely that only one group will hold all the power there is
        constant war and fighting
        breaking out when one group or another tries to grab more power. Order is maintained by force and everyone
        either shows loyality to
        strength or is relentlessly hunted. the middle ring of the planet is called the merchant district for it is the
        location that all the goods
        are moved off planet to be sold to the greater galaxy at large. similar to the dark side of the planet there is
        no one central governing
        authority. Yet there is some intergalactic policing presence so it makes it so that everyone is responsible for
        protecting themselves and
        their goods.

    <div class="panel">
      <p>Over the centuries many caverns and underground tunnels have either been dug or discovered with many ancient
        magical beasts and treasures
        to be found. These caverns have mostly attracted many the adventurer or seeker of wealth to find them and return
        the lost items for a massive
        reward. There have been countless rumors of the kinds of beasts that linger there and many have died trying
        exploring the caves alone. the
