      <p>
        Gliamoor is one of the few worlds that has no central governing bodies. Even thought it is quite the wealthy
        place full of very profitable
        exports, no action has been taken by the intergalactic governing body to change the power dynamic between the
        two separate governments that
        each only care about their side of the planet. The side facing its star runs quite like a dictatorship where the
        wealthy farmers and
        politician create and maintain laws that only really benefit them with most of the lower class citizens
        essentially being slaves to their
        whims. The side not facing the star is a blend of lawlessness and survival of the fittest. The one who holds the
        power is the one who has
        defeated all of his rivals. Since it is never likely that only one group will hold all the power there is
        constant war and fighting
        breaking out when one group or another tries to grab more power. Order is maintained by force and everyone
        either shows devotion to
        strength or is relentlessly hunted. the middle ring of the planet is called the merchant district for it is the
        location that all the goods
        are moved off planet to be sold to the greater galaxy at large. similar to the dark side of the planet there is
        no one central governing
        authority. Yet there is some intergalactic policing presence so it makes it so that everyone is responsible for
        protecting themselves and
        their goods.

        Over the centuries many caverns and underground tunnels have either been dug or discovered with many ancient
        magical beasts and treasures
        to be found. These caverns have mostly attracted many the adventurer or seeker of wealth to find them and return
        the lost items for a massive
        reward. There have been countless rumors of the kinds of beasts that linger there and many have died trying
        exploring the caves alone. Many rich and powerful people have decided that these caverns are the idea place
        to store there ill begotten treasures and artifacts simply because of the deadly nature of the caverns protecting
        them easily being hoarded there. In addition to the caves there are several underground structures from ancient and
        civilizations that have long since been abandoned. These underground structures are also full of ancient treasures
        guarded by magical traps and naturally built traps to protect their long abandoned treasure. The beasts who dwell in
        these caverns and call this place home have also developed a unique biology to take advantage of the bioluminescent
        nature that much of the dark side of the planet also enjoys taking advantage of to have a thriving and beautiful
        natural diversity of animal and plant life alike.

        Glimoor's neutral zone is the zone of trade and selling the goods from both sides of the planet. There is no official
        governing body over this area because of the disputed nature of both sides claiming it is under their control but
        employing no specific enforcement of their rule there due to the great distance from that zone to the capitals of both
        sides not having significant enough resources to maintain a large enough force to maintain control. This resulted in
        many small factions that all control one or more monopolistic control of the one set of goods they sell to the greater
        galaxy at large. Aside from the galactic forces protecting the magic portals that demonstrate the only method of entering
        or leaving the planet at all. Each faction that is trying for control, only tries to control their portion of the zone
        they can reasonably command. Not a single group would ever dare to seize control of the portals off world because
        the galactic forces guarding them are never to be messed with because they are the most well trained soldiers in the
        galaxy.

      <h3>Gliamoor's light side</h3>
      <p>
        On the light side of the planet the vast majority of the land is devoted to farming and raising cattle in an
        environment that never suffers from a lack of growing time that is limited by other planets that have a day/night
        cycle. There are a few cities that dot this side but the bulk of the towns are farming towns that have the farmers
        living close to their crops or cattle. Several of this farms are owned by one or two families and almost all of their
        workers are closer to slaves working to paying off their debts instead of being free men who can work for their own
        benefit. Each of these families also is wealthy enough to privately fund their own personal armies and they are in
        charge of protecting their goods and enforcing the rule of the families in power.

      <h3>Gliamoor's dark side</h3>
      <p>
        the dark side of the planet is a much more hostile environment to the inhabitants who call home there. The dark side
        has had a lot less time to see much civilization develop compared to the light side simply because of all the dangerous
        beasts that freely travel and defend their own supply of resources that the planet provides. Many of the plant life appears
        similar to the same native plants that grow on the light side but all the life on this side has developed bioluminescence
        in the absence of any consistent light source. In addition to the overall tempature being colder here the ice that forms
        on this planet also is known for its incredibly high melting point. So much so that depending on where you could find the
        ice it would melt around the same point that most metals would start to melt. This side of the planet entire farming production
        is controlled by one man and he is the governing body that runs this side.
