        <p> I am persuing a degree in software engineering with a hope of owning and operating my own video game company.
            I am a huge nerd in every sense of the word. I love video games, movies, TV shows, and anything that tells a story.
            I am married. I will married for two years end of april. We have a three month old girl and I have much fun spending
            a lot of time with my wife and baby, if I am not doing homework.
            
            The part I love about BYUI the most is a wierd one but a simple one as well. I love that
            there is a much greater focus on the learning and studying than any school pride or emphasis on sports events.
            I never thought I would like how much that is not present but it really helps the whole school develop a love of learning
            above all.
            
            Since I have no issue with learning all I can about the art of programming in general I will see a time where
            I may need to know how to design a website even if I have to do it all myself. I like knowing how to do things so I can 
            make it even better in my own way. I have been a member of the church all my life and I served a mission in Ventura, California
            I have been home five years now and I have so many favorite quotes from our leaders. the one that sticks out to me the most is 
            when president Holland said, "the first great commandment is to love God, but the first great truth is that he loves you." My
            favorite scripture is in ecclesaties 1:18.
